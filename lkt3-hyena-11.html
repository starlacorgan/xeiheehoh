I don't think I've seen a more complete list anywhere on the internet, which is my reason for making this post. I also created a Google Doc which you can view here (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KDAhRnRxY8uWRRhGxBJxXYbVZW11Y8EiLiQoRNgWSj4/edit?usp=sharing) if you want to make a copy and keep track of your own collection.

I haven't. 
Long time lurker, I'd starting making a map of all the air drop crates I'd discovered because I realized there were quite a few, and even after the dye's stop droping, they will always drop a gear piece/weapon and a mod (as they reset 24hrs after opening). I saw a few posts on here recently about them so thought I'd share what I'd (badly/mspaint) kept track of for myself. I just added the numbers to post it on here.
